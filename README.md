# Palmoria-Project
This is my second project work after my 3-month training from DSA at Incubator hub. I analyzed the gender inequality biased issues experienced by Palmoria organization, using parameters like salary, bonus ratings and employee data.

# PROJECT TOPIC: Palmora Group HR Analysis

## Project Overview
The project is intended to identify and assess the gender inequality pay gap that has affected the image of the company. The insight gottten from the analysis will serve as a tool for decision making to stakeholders in this project.

## Project Source
The data used for this project was sent directly from the Incubator Hub and is solely for the project alone.

### Tools Used

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, we performed the following actions;
1. **Data loading and Inspection**
2. **Handling missing variables**
3. **Data cleaning and formatting**
4. **Created a merger sheet column to assess values of rating**
5. **Created and performed DAX functions with datasets**
6. **Determine measures which was used to calculate functions like average, count, etc**
7. **Built dashboards for holistic insights through the use of charts, graphs, slicers, and sattered plots to visualize data**

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Based on anlysis, this project answered the following question 
- What is the gender distribution of the organisation?
- What are the insight on ratings based on gender?
- Identifying the gender pay gap as well as department or region that the company should focus on.
- Visualizing the pay distribution of employees by a price range bucket.
- Calculating of bonus rate and apportionment based on ratings and bonus rule.

### Analysis
Due to time factor and deadline for project submission, I was unable to answer all the questions in the exploratory analysis.

Meanwhile, from the below dashboard, it was gathered that a total sum of 1,015 employees work in Palmoria coy.  
Moreso, the gender factor is an ideal situation as there were no more male than female and vice versa. However, some of the employees refuse to disclose their gender for reasons best known to them, which has been captured as "undisclosed" in the data.
The areas that the company need to focus on for gender inequality and biasednes is towards each department. It was observed from the dashbaord of the employee rating analysis that the gender for each varies. This also is a factor to their payment difference as the pay structure will be determined by individual competencies, skills and significant contribution to the organisation. Hence, salary will varies even with employee in the same department.

Here are my dashboard and my raw files for reference.
